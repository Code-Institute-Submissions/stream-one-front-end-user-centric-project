## UX Design

Details of the UX design and research process is available in the repo "supporting-documentation" folder. The documents show how I approached the design of the site using the 5 layers approach. (Strategy, Structure, Scope, Skeleton, Surface). 

## Build Approach

1. I decided to build the site using a Mobile First Approach. Concentrating on the mobile layouts for each page first before building upwards to larger devices. I used Chrome dev-tools device emulation to achieve this. 
2. I used Bootstrap for it's grid system ONLY. I created a custom bootstrap css file which excluded any components or bootstrap features I didn't intend on using. The aim of this was to aid in site loading time. 
3. I used Font-Awesome for social media icons and calender icon. The main navigation icons I created in Illustrator. 
4. The menu "burger" icon is a Bootstrap drop-down menu with custom styling.
5. Photographs were a combination of my own, and free to use photos from https://pxhere.com/, in each case photo's were tweaked and optimized in photo-shop before being implimented in the site. 

The aim in minimising Bootstrap usage was to push myself to write as much custom CSS as possible. The purpose of which was to hopefully arrive at an outcome that looks and feels more bespoke than perhaps it otherwise would. 

## Testing

Manual and technical testing of the site was undertaken and passed. 

1. Chrome dev tools used throughout to test responsiveness.
2. Testing the site across different devices in real world scenarios. Mobiles, Tablets, Laptops, and Desktops.
3. Testing hyperlinks and menu's across the site. 
4. W3C code validator to pass HTML and CSS.
